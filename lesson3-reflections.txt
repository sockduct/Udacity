When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
> Remote repos are useful for backing up your work.  If anything happens to your local files or
> to your computer, everything is safe on GitHub.  Remote repos are useful for keeping multiple
> devices in sync such as if you're using multiple systems.  They are also useful for
> collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
> Changes may be made by other people or even you from another system.  You may want to experiment
> with some features/ideas locally and not necessarily want the latest auto-merged in.
